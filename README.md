# Explanation
This is a Wiki that serves as a repository for Cytoscape core and core app testing materials. 

It is broken into sections that can be realigned as needs change and group conscientiousness shifts.

The wiki is organized around sections (e.g., Session Files, Feature Tests, Release Tests, etc). 

Sections are organized by sub-sections depending on the needs of the section (e.g., for Session Files, organized by who donated the file).

Subsections contain collections of pages titled to describe content.

Editing the structure and article content is encouraged, as are comments on article content.
